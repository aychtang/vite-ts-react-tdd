# README

Work in progress :) I'm building this repo to help educate on best practices for React readability and testing principles.

## Install

-   This repo uses `pnpm`, you can find the installation instructions at https://pnpm.io/installation.

-   App installation:
    ```
    pnpm i
    ```

## Test

```
pnpm test
```

## Run

```
pnpm dev
```

## The Continuous Deployment feedback cycle

-   Decide what to build
-   Write a new test for that behaviour
-   Write code to pass that test
-   Refactor
-   Merge new code to main branch
-   Automated deploy when code is merged
